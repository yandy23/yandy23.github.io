    <h1>The History of Basketball</h1>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Basketball, colloquially referred to as hoops,[1] is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five
        players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a
        basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46
        cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the
        opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind
        the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated
        to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end
        of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is
        mandated.

        Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate,
        both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shotsâ€”the lay-up, the jump
        shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either
        offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a
        violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with
        both hands then resume dribbling.

        The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the
        second tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small
        forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who
        implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player
        positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.

        Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States,
        basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.[2] The<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association">,National Basketball Association </a>
        (NBA)is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries,
        talent, and level of competition.[3][4] Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to
        continental championships such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EuroLeague">,Euroleague </a> and
        the Basketball Champions League Americas. The <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup">,FIBA Basketball World Cup </a> and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_at_the_Summer_Olympics#Men's_tournaments">,Mens Olympic
            Basketball Tournament </a> are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams
        from around the world. Each continent hosts regional competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA
        AmeriCup.

        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Women%27s_Basketball_World_Cup">,FIBA Women's Basketball World
            Cup </a> and Women's Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national teams from continental
        championships. The main North American league is the WNBA (NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship is
        also popular), whereas strongest European clubs participate in the EuroLeague Women.</p>

    <h1>History:The Creation</h1>
    <img id= "naismith" src= "https://cdn.britannica.com/77/9877-004-8C5A694E/James-Naismith-ball-peach-basket-basketball-equipment.jpg" alt="Naismith">
    <p>In early December 1891, Canadian James Naismith,[5] a physical education professor and instructor at the
        International Young Men's Christian Association Training School[6] (YMCA) (today, Springfield College) in
        Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day. He sought a vigorous indoor
        game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters. After
        rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he wrote the basic rules and
        nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track. In contrast with modern basketball nets, this peach basket
        retained its bottom, and balls had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored; this proved
        inefficient, however, so the bottom of the basket was removed, allowing the balls to be poked out with a long
        dowel each time.

        Basketball was originally played with a soccer ball. These round balls from "association football" were made, at
        the time, with a set of laces to close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the other
        sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped outside-in.[7][8] These laces could cause bounce
        passes and dribbling to be unpredictable.[9] Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was invented, and
        this change to the game was endorsed by Naismith. (Whereas in American football, the lace construction proved to
        be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day.) The first balls made specifically for basketball were
        brown, and it was only in the late 1950s that Tony Hinkle, searching for a ball that would be more visible to
        players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in common use. Dribbling was not part of
        the original game except for the "bounce pass" to teammates. Passing the ball was the primary means of ball
        movement. Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls.[dubious â€“
        discuss] Dribbling was common by 1896, with a rule against the double dribble by 1898.[10]

        The peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards. A further
        change was soon made, so the ball merely passed through. Whenever a person got the ball in the basket, his team
        would gain a point. Whichever team got the most points won the game.[11] The baskets were originally nailed to
        the mezzanine balcony of the playing court, but this proved impractical when spectators in the balcony began to
        interfere with shots. The backboard was introduced to prevent this interference; it had the additional effect of
        allowing rebound shots.[12] Naismith's handwritten diaries, discovered by his granddaughter in early 2006,
        indicate that he was nervous about the new game he had invented, which incorporated rules from a children's game
        called duck on a rock, as many had failed before it.

        Frank Mahan, one of the players from the original first game, approached Naismith after the Christmas break, in
        early 1892, asking him what he intended to call his new game. Naismith replied that he hadn't thought of it
        because he had been focused on just getting the game started. Mahan suggested that it be called "Naismith ball",
        at which he laughed, saying that a name like that would kill any game. Mahan then said, "Why not call it
        basketball?" Naismith replied, "We have a basket and a ball, and it seems to me that would be a good name for
        it."[13][14] The first official game was played in the YMCA gymnasium in Albany, New York, on January 20, 1892,
        with nine players. The game ended at 1â€“0; the shot was made from 25 feet (7.6 m), on a court just half the size
        of a present-day Streetball or National Basketball Association (NBA) court.

        At the time, football was being played with 10 to a team (which was increased to 11). When winter weather got
        too icy to play football, teams were taken indoors, and it was convenient to have them split in half and play
        basketball with five on each side. By 1897â€“1898 teams of five became standard.</p>

    <h1>College Basketball</h1>
    <img id="CB" src="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/gthwqnFx1OkIhedyVOoxeLZiM-Q=/1200x0/top/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IRBN7R5VYRCLPCYC7A7RI35AWQ.jpg" alt="College">
    <p>Basketball's early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the United States, and it quickly spread through
        the United States and Canada. By 1895, it was well established at several women's high schools. While YMCA was
        responsible for initially developing and spreading the game, within a decade it discouraged the new sport, as
        rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from YMCA's primary mission. However, other amateur sports clubs,
        colleges, and professional clubs quickly filled the void. In the years before World War I, the Amateur Athletic
        Union and the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (forerunner of the NCAA) vied for
        control over the rules for the game. The first pro league, the National Basketball League, was formed in 1898 to
        protect players from exploitation and to promote a less rough game. This league only lasted five years.

        James Naismith was instrumental in establishing college basketball. His colleague C.O. Beamis fielded the first
        college basketball team just a year after the Springfield YMCA game at the suburban Pittsburgh Geneva
        College.[15] Naismith himself later coached at the University of Kansas for six years, before handing the reins
        to renowned coach Forrest "Phog" Allen. Naismith's disciple Amos Alonzo Stagg brought basketball to the
        University of Chicago, while Adolph Rupp, a student of Naismith's at Kansas, enjoyed great success as coach at
        the University of Kentucky. On February 9, 1895, the first intercollegiate 5-on-5 game was played at Hamline
        University between Hamline and the School of Agriculture, which was affiliated with the University of
        Minnesota.[16][17][18] The School of Agriculture won in a 9â€“3 game.

        In 1901, colleges, including the University of Chicago, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth
        College, the University of Minnesota, the U.S. Naval Academy, the University of Colorado and Yale University
        began sponsoring men's games. In 1905, frequent injuries on the football field prompted President Theodore
        Roosevelt to suggest that colleges form a governing body, resulting in the creation of the Intercollegiate
        Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). In 1910, that body would change its name to the National
        Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The first Canadian interuniversity basketball game was played at YMCA in
        Kingston, Ontario on February 6, 1904, when McGill Universityâ€”Naismith's alma materâ€”visited Queen's University.
        McGill won 9â€“7 in overtime; the score was 7â€“7 at the end of regulation play, and a ten-minute overtime period
        settled the outcome. A good turnout of spectators watched the game.[19]

        The first men's national championship tournament, the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball
        tournament, which still exists as the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) tournament, was
        organized in 1937. The first national championship for NCAA teams, the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in
        New York, was organized in 1938; the NCAA national tournament would begin one year later. College basketball was
        rocked by gambling scandals from 1948 to 1951, when dozens of players from top teams were implicated in match
        fixing and point shaving. Partially spurred by an association with cheating, the NIT lost support to the NCAA
        tournament.</p>

    <h1>Professional Basketball</h1>
    <p>Teams abounded throughout the 1920s. There were hundreds of men's professional basketball teams in towns and
        cities all over the United States, and little organization of the professional game. Players jumped from team to
        team and teams played in armories and smoky dance halls. Leagues came and went. Barnstorming squads such as the
        Original Celtics and two all-African American teams, the New York Renaissance Five ("Rens") and the (still
        existing) Harlem Globetrotters played up to two hundred games a year on their national tours.

        In 1946, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) was formed. The first game was played in Toronto, Ontario,
        Canada between the Toronto Huskies and New York Knickerbockers on November 1, 1946. Three seasons later, in
        1949, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) to form the National Basketball Association
        (NBA). By the 1950s, basketball had become a major college sport, thus paving the way for a growth of interest
        in professional basketball. In 1959, a basketball hall of fame was founded in Springfield, Massachusetts, site
        of the first game. Its rosters include the names of great players, coaches, referees and people who have
        contributed significantly to the development of the game. The hall of fame has people who have accomplished many
        goals in their career in basketball. An upstart organization, the American Basketball Association, emerged in
        1967 and briefly threatened the NBA's dominance until the ABA-NBA merger in 1976. Today the NBA is the top
        professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.

    <p>The NBA has featured many famous players, including George Mikan, the first dominating "big man"; ball-handling
        wizard Bob Cousy and defensive genius Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics; charismatic center Wilt Chamberlain,
        who originally played for the barnstorming Harlem Globetrotters; all-around stars Oscar Robertson and JerryWest;
        more recent big men Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon and Karl Malone; playmakers John

        Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol and Tony Parker; more recent superstars LeBron James, Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant;
        and the three players who many credit with ushering the professional game to its highest level of
        popularity during the 1980s and 1990s: Larry Bird, Earvin "Magic" Johnson, and Michael Jordan.</p>
